# Water-quality-analysis
To analyze a dataset collected from CEFAS and, using neural networks, detect when threshold levels of certain substances are reached / exceeded.
We'll be using data from the UK's Centre for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture (CEFAS). CEFAS keeps track of water quality by dispatching vessels (much like the Endeavour on the right) to collect samples and examine the environment. A variety of compounds are monitored, including phytoplankton, with which we will be working today.
Here's a quick and easy explanation of what phytoplankton is and why it's important. Essentially, it is a naturally occurring species of micro algae that is a vital part of its ecosystem, providing food for marine life among other things (in its natural volume and concentration). If phytoplankton becomes out of control, it can cause a dangerous algal bloom, which can affect fish, animals, and birds.
